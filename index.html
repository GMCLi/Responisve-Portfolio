    <p>My name is Gordon Li. Originally from Hong Kong, I moved to Toronto in 2014.
        I went to university in Ohio, majoring in biology and minoring in marine sciences.
        Previous to this bootcamp, I do not have any knowledge in computer sciences, much less coding.
        However, I have always had an interest in the subject and I certainly plan on giving it my all.
        Since almsot every busy small or big has it's own website, server, etc. it means that
        knowledge in this subject will be an invaluable addition to my skillset for my career.
